## Why Open Source Fonts?

We believe fonts should be free to use, modify, and share. Our philosophy is inspired by the open source model of **Velvetyne Type Foundry**. Learn more about Velvetyneâ€™s philosophy [here](https://velvetyne.fr/about/).

We use the **SIL Open Font License (OFL, Version 1.1)** for all our typefaces. This license ensures:
- Fonts remain free for personal and commercial use.
- Modifications are allowed as long as derivative works are also licensed under OFL.
- Distribution encourages collaboration without restricting creativity.

## Unified Font Repository (UFR)

The **Unified Font Repository** (UFR) standardizes font project structures for clarity and collaboration. Developed by Velvetyne, the UFR ensures each repository contains:
- **`LICENSE.txt`**: Legal details, including the SIL OFL.
- **`README.md`**: Overview of the typeface.
- **`FONTLOG.md`**: Development history and contributions.
- **`METADATA.yml`**: Core information about the typeface (e.g., designer, tags, writing systems).

### Benefits of UFR:
- **Consistency**: Predictable structure for users and contributors.
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation and open licensing.
- **Scalability**: Adding new fonts is seamless.

Our website pulls font data directly from the METADATA.yml file in each repository. This ensures the repository serves as a central, flexible hub for font information as projects evolve. This allows for: 

- Real-time updates: Website content reflects repository changes immediately.
- Accessible information: Users can easily view details like font names, descriptions, designers, and licensing.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from designers and developers. Hereâ€™s how to get involved:

1. **Fork Our Repositories**: Clone any of our font repositories or the [UFR template](https://github.com/mother-type/Unified-Font-Repository).
2. **Add Your Typeface**: Create a new font using the UFR structure.
3. **Submit Pull Requests**: Share your improvements or additions.
